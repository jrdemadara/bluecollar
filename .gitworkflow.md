# Git Workflow

This document describes the branching workflow for the **BlueCollar** project.

---

## Branches

- **main**
    - Production-ready, stable code.
    - Only tested, reviewed code is merged here.

- **dev**
    - Development branch for integrating new features.
    - Acts as a staging area before merging to `main`.

- **feature branches**
    - Named `feature/<feature-name>`
    - Created from `dev`
    - One feature per branch
    - Merged back to `dev` after completion and testing

---

## Workflow Steps

1. **Start working on a new feature**
    - Make sure you are on the latest `dev`:
      ```bash
      git checkout dev
      git pull
      ```
    - Create a new feature branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
      ```
    - Develop and commit changes on this branch
    - Push the feature branch to the remote:
      ```bash
      git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>
      ```

2. **Finish a feature**
    - Merge the feature branch into `dev`:
      ```bash
      git checkout dev
      git pull
      git merge feature/<feature-name>
      git push
      ```
    - Optionally, delete the feature branch:
      ```bash
      git branch -d feature/<feature-name>
      git push origin --delete feature/<feature-name>
      ```

3. **Release to production**
    - When `dev` is fully tested and ready:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git pull
      git merge dev
      git push
      ```

## Branch Naming Conventions

- Features: `feature/<feature-name>`
    - example: `feature/welcome-screen`

- Bug fixes: `bugfix/<bug-description>`
    - example: `bugfix/login-error`

- Hotfixes: `hotfix/<urgent-fix>`
    - example: `hotfix/crash-on-ios`

---

## Notes

âœ… Always **pull before you start working** to avoid conflicts  
âœ… Keep commits small and meaningful  
âœ… Use pull requests (PRs) if collaborating with a team  
âœ… Test your feature branches before merging to `dev`  
âœ… Keep `main` production-stable at all times
